<h2>Description</h2>
This web-application predicts the most likely animal kingdom an animal belongs to that contains the selected features. Users are able to select different features on the
web-app and visualize how different features lead to a different animal kingdom output. The machine learning model used to predict the output was created using an 
algorithm called random forest, and was performed on a dataset containing 214 animals, their features, and their animal kingdom classification.
